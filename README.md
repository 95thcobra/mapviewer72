About the repository
--------------------

This is a hacked-up version of mudclient72 designed for viewing the RSC
map offline.

It can load maps in the old RSC map format (pre-landXX.jag and mapXX.jag,
when only mapXX.jag was used).

To run
-------

`java mudclient`

Controls
--------

* Arrow keys - Move around
* Square brackets - Rotate camera
* Space - Randomise location (do this initially)
* m/n - Move up and down levels
